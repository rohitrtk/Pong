# Pong

First attempt at a pong remake, decided to use C++ because I had never used it before and thought a good way for me to learn it
would be for me to code a project in it, for most part I had no idea what I was doing and this took far too long because of the syntax differences between this and Java. But yea, works either way :)
Use only for reference please!

Future plans are to;
  * Make the game better and in less time
  * Make code more efficent (Use pointers, arrays and w/e other fancy stuff C++ has)
  * Try and make some sort of AI so the user can play against
  * Try to make multiplayer support (However unlikely)
